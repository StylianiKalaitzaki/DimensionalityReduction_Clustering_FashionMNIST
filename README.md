# Fashion-MNIST Clustering with Dimensionality Reduction

This project explores the Fashion-MNIST dataset using various dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different techniques in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential features and enabling effective clustering.

## Overview

The Python code provided in this repository performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The Fashion-MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed by reshaping and scaling the input images.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Factor Analysis (FA)
   - Independent Component Analysis (FastICA)
   - Stacked Autoencoder (SAE)
   - Convolutional Stacked Autoencoder (CSAE)
   - Raw Data (No Dimensionality Reduction)

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - MiniBatchKMeans
   - DBSCAN
   - Agglomerative Clustering (AGG)
   - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
   - Bisecting KMeans

4. **Evaluation**: Performance evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, Davies-Bouldin index, and Adjusted Rand index are calculated for each combination of dimensionality reduction technique and clustering algorithm.

5. **Visualization**: Original images and their reconstructed counterparts are visualized to assess the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

## Results

The results of the clustering evaluation, including performance scores for each combination of dimensionality reduction technique and clustering algorithm, are stored in the `output.xlsx` file generated by the script.
